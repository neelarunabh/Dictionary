# Dictionary 

This is bizarre. Today October 9th, we are getting today's Word of the Day at https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-day/,  but we are not getting today's Synonym of the Day at https://www.thesaurus.com/e/synonym-of-the-day/. We are only able to see yesterday's Synonym of the Day ("posit"). I cannot understand what happened to today's Synonym of the Day?
